`@remotion/media-parser` works in the Browser, Node.js and Bun.

However, all of these require some quite modern versions (considered modern as of August 2024).

## For parsing

For parsing a video, the following minimum versions are required:

- Node.js: 20.0.0
- Bun 1.0.0
- Chrome 111
- Edge 111
- Safari 16.4
- Firefox 128

### Feature detection

Use this to check if the runtime supports `parseMedia()`:

```tsx
const canUseMediaParser = typeof fetch === 'function' && typeof new ArrayBuffer().resize === 'function';
```

## For using WebCodecs

WebCodecs support is not tied to `@remotion/media-parser` itself, but if you use it to extract samples, you need to use the following minimum versions:

- Chrome 94
- Edge 94
- Safari 16.4 - No support for `AudioDecoder`
- Firefox - No support, but in development
