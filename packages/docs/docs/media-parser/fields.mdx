The following fields are available in [`parseMedia()`](/docs/media-parser/parse-media):

### `dimensions`

_`{width: number, height: number} | null`_

The dimensions of the video.  
Any rotation is already applied - the dimensions are like a media player would show them.  
Use `unrotatedDimensions` to get the dimensions before rotation.

If the media passed is an audio file, this will return `null`.

### `durationInSeconds`

_number | null_

The duration of the video in seconds.  
Only returns a non-null value if the duration is stored in the metadata.

### `slowDurationInSeconds`

_number_

The duration of the video in seconds, but it is guaranteed to return a value.  
If needed, the entire video file is read to determine the duration.

### `name`

_string_

The name of the file.

### `container`

_"mp4" | "webm" | "avi" | "transport-stream" | "mp3" | "aac" | "wav" | "flac"_

The container of the file.

### `size`

_number | null_

The size of the input in bytes.

### `mimeType`

_string | null_

The MIME type of the file that was returned when the file was fetched.  
Only available if using the `fetchReader` or `webFileReader`.

### `structure`

The internal structure of the video. Unstable, internal data structure, refer to the TypeScript types to see what's inside.

### `fps`

_number | null_

The frame rate of the video.  
Only returns a non-null value if the frame rate is stored in the metadata.

### `slowFps`

_number_

The frame rate of the video, but it is guaranteed to return a value.  
If needed, the entire video file is read to determine the frame rate.

### `videoCodec`

The video codec of the file.  
If multiple video tracks are present, this will be the first video track.  
One of `"h264"`, `"h265"`, `"vp8"`, `"vp9"`, `"av1"`, `"prores"` or `null` (in case of an unknown codec).

### `audioCodec`

The audio codec of the file.  
If multiple audio tracks are present, this will be the first audio track.  
One of `'aac'`, `'mp3'`, `'aiff'`, `'opus'`, `'pcm'`, `'flac'`, `'unknown'` (audio is there but not recognized) or `null` (in case of no audio detected).

### `metadata`

Metadata fields such as ID3 tags or EXIF data.  
See [metadata](/docs/media-parser/tags) for more information.

### `location`

The location of the video was shot. Either `null` if not available or:

- `latitude`: The latitude of the location
- `longitude`: The longitude of the location
- `altitude`: The altitude of the location (can be `null`)
- `horizontalAccuracy`: The horizontal accuracy of the location (can be `null`)

### `tracks`

Returns an object of two two arrays `videoTracks` and `audioTracks`.  
The data structure of them is not yet stable.

### `keyframes`

Return type: <TsType type="MediaParserKeyframe[] | null" source="@remotion/media-parser" />

An array of keyframes. Each keyframe has the following structure:

- `presentationTimeInSeconds`: The time in seconds when the keyframe should be presented
- `decodingTimeInSeconds`: The time in seconds when the keyframe should be decoded
- `positionInBytes`: The position in bytes where the keyframe is located in the file
- `sizeInBytes`: The size of the keyframe in bytes
- `trackId`: The ID of the track the frame belongs to

Only being returned if the keyframe information are stored in the metadata, otherwise `null`.

### `slowKeyframes`

Return type: <TsType type="MediaParserKeyframe[]" source="@remotion/media-parser" />

An array of keyframes, same as [`keyframes`](#keyframes), but it is guaranteed to return a value.

Will read the entire video file to determine the keyframes.

### `slowNumberOfFrames`

_number_

The number of video frames in the media.  
Will read the entire video file to determine the number of frames.

### `unrotatedDimensions`

_`{width: number, height: number}`_

The dimensions of the video before rotation.

### `isHdr`

_`boolean`_

Whether the video is in HDR (High dynamic range).

### `rotation`

_number_

The rotation of the video in degrees (e.g. `-90` for a 90Â° counter-clockwise rotation).

### `images`

Return type: <TsType type="MediaParserEmbeddedImage[]" source="@remotion/media-parser" />

Embedded images in the file, for example an album cover inside an MP3.  
Each array element has the following fields:

- `mimeType`: The MIME type of the image, or `null`
- `description`: A description of the image, or `null`
- `data`: The image data as a `Uint8Array`

### `sampleRate`

_number | null_

The audio sample rate, if there is an audio track.

### `numberOfAudioChannels`

_number | null_

The number of audio channels, if there is an audio track.

### `slowAudioBitrate`

_number_

The audio bitrate in bits per second. `null` if there is no audio track.

:::note
1 byte is 8 bits.
:::

### `slowVideoBitrate`

_number | null_

The video bitrate in bits per second. `null` if there is no video track.

:::note
1 byte is 8 bits.
:::

### `m3uStreams`

Only for .m3u8, this will return a non-`null` value if the file is a playlist.

An array of objects with the following fields:

- `bandwidth`: The bandwidth of the stream. May be `null`.
- `averageBandwidth`: The average bandwidth of the stream. May be `null`.
- `resolution`: The resolution of the stream. May be `null`.
- `codecs`: The codec strings of the stream as an array May be `null`.
- `url`: The URI of the stream
- `id`: A unique identifier that Remotion gives the stream
- `associatedPlaylists`: Audio tracks that are connected to this stream but live in a separate file.
  - `url`: The URL of the audio track
  - `autoselect`: Corresponds to the `AUTOSELECT` attribute in the HLS playlist
  - `default`: Corresponds to the `DEFAULT` attribute in the HLS playlist
  - `language`: The language of the audio track
  - `name`: The name of the audio track
  - `groupId`: The group ID of the audio track
  - `channels`: The number of audio channels in the audio track, or `null`.
